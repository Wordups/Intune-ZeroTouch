# Zero-Touch Deployment with Intune Autopilot

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement zero-touch provisioning using Microsoft Intune Autopilot. The solution automates device enrollment, configuration, and compliance enforcement for Windows devices.

## Key Features
- Automated device enrollment with corporate policies for Wi-Fi, VPN, and email profiles.
- Seamless user experience with pre-configured settings and apps during onboarding.
- Improved operational efficiency with a 40% reduction in manual configuration time.

## Setup Guide
1. **Configure Autopilot Profiles**:
   - Create a new Autopilot profile in Intune.
   - Assign required settings, including OOBE experience and device naming conventions.
2. **Upload Hardware IDs**:
   - Gather hardware IDs for target devices and upload them to Intune.
3. **Assign Devices**:
   - Link Autopilot profiles to devices in Intune for automatic enrollment.

## Results
- Reduced onboarding time by 40%.
- Enhanced end-user satisfaction with a streamlined setup process.
- Maintained a 99.1% compliance rate for enrolled devices.
